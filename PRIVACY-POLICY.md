# Cusco Go – Privacy Policy

Effective date: September 10, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how Cusco Go ("the App") handles information when you use the App. We respect your privacy. The App is designed to process most data on your device and does not collect personal data on our servers.

## Information We Access

- Camera and Photos: With your permission, the App lets you capture photos or select images from your library to participate in gameplay. Photos are stored locally on your device. You may also choose to save images back to your Photos library.
- Location (Approximate GPS): With your permission, the App may access your device location to attach an approximate coordinate to a capture for in‑app features (e.g., map and context). Location data is stored locally with the capture and is not transmitted to us.
- On‑device Storage: The App stores game data (e.g., captures, thumbnails, and metadata) locally using on‑device storage (SQLite and the app’s document directory).
- Apple Game Center: If available and enabled on your device, the App uses Apple Game Center to authenticate and submit leaderboard scores. Your Game Center profile and scores are handled by Apple in accordance with Apple’s policies. We do not receive your Game Center credentials.

## Information We Do Not Collect

- We do not collect, transmit, or store your personal data on our servers.
- We do not use third‑party analytics SDKs.
- We do not serve ads or use tracking technologies for advertising purposes.

## Data Sharing

We do not share your data with third parties. Leaderboard participation is facilitated by Apple Game Center; any data used by Game Center is managed by Apple.

## Your Choices and Controls

- Permissions: You can grant or revoke Camera, Photos, and Location permissions at any time in your device Settings.
- Deleting Data: You can delete captures from within the App. Deleting the App from your device will remove locally stored App data.

## Children’s Privacy

The App can be used by a general audience. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided personal information to us, please contact us so we can address it.

## Security

Because data remains on your device, please secure your device with a passcode and keep your operating system up to date.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the App or legal requirements. Material changes will be posted in this repository.
